    "## Models\n",
    "I created numerous models for our team. Here is a list of them and their purposes, along with some code snippets\n",
    "### binaryLearningGame.py\n",
    "This model interact's with Weston's game. It stores the scores of users who play his game. This model while originally developed did undergo changes by Weston, but I think it is important to acknowledge the foundation I put in. I created the basic data storage of id, username, user_id, user_score and user_difficulty. I also added all the initial CRUD features, with update being changed by Weston.\n",

    "    _user_difficulty = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### binaryOverflowContent.py\n",
    "This model stores the posts of users on our Binary Overflow page, similar to Stack overflow. Unfortunately we weren't able to fully use this model as it was originally intended for users to be able to click on posts and open a page with only the post on it. We had issues with the fronend making this impossible within the timeframe. \n",
    "#### Key parts\n",
    "Some cool things I did with this module is db.relationships, which define relationships with another model with a built-in function too flask. I learned about these when doing research on easier ways to make two closely related models interact.\n",

    "```\n",
    "You can see the defined relationships are cascading. This means when I make a change to this model it'll affect those related models. In this case we are deleting them when this post gets deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else I did was counting the votes, this function while simple did take a while to make due to my own stubborness. I wanted the votes to be stored in the same model, but others on Stack Overflow stated that it was simply better to store in a second related model. Here is how I counted the votes in the other model\n",

    "This part of the API was meant for the individual pages that you could open by interacting with the posts. This was unfortunately never integrated into the frontend due to time constraints. It had a GET call for the post itself so it can be built on the dynamic page and used URL parameters so that users could bookmark the page. It also had a POST feature for creating new posts from the page. The interesting parts are the PUT and DELETE which would check if the user matched the creator before deleting the post. This could be improved by allowing admins to delete the posts as well though.\n",
