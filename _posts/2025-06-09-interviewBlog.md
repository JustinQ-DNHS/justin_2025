## Introduction: My Interests and How They Intersect with Coding

Hello, my name is Justin Quach, and I am passionate about gaming, coding, and puzzles. Coding allows me to bring these interests to life by solving real-world problems through technology. My journey in programming has centered around creating tools and platforms that are both meaningful and impactful.

# Education
Del Norte High School
## Technical Classes
- AP Computer Science Principles
- Robotics
- Computer Science and Software Engineering

## Overview of Projects & Team Collaboration

Over the past year, I've worked on several team-based projects that taught me how to balance leadership and collaboration. Some highlights include:

- **Update the Nest**: A project based on flask, using a database to store post information. Using RESTful methodology to fetch and post a JSON body which is used to buiid the page. Along with converting images to base64 in order to more efficiently store them.
- **Binary Overflow**: A project based on flask and RESTful princples, with a multitude of databases related to each other in order to build a page that allowed users to both create posts and to comment and like posts as well.
- **Bitshift: 0101**: A game focused on teaching binary to students interested in learning more about it. It covers concepts such as binary basic arithmetic, bitshifts, binary overflows, and point float errors.

In all of these, I practiced **Agile methodologies**, **pair programming**, and maintained **strong communication using version control tools** like Git and GitHub.

## Teamwork Methodologies & Participation Artifacts

In our teams, we implemented the following practices:

- **Daily stand-ups** to coordinate progress and blockers
- **GitHub Projects** for issue tracking and Kanban board-style task management
- **Code reviews and pull requests** to ensure collaboration and maintain code quality

Artifacts:
- [Binary Overflow Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Voyager162/projects/)
- [Bitshift: 0101 Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Frogpants/projects/1)
