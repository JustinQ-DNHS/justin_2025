# Who Am I?
My name is Justin Quach, I am a senior at Del Norte High School. I've been going to Del Norte for 3 years and am now on my 4th and final year here. I had always been interested in programming since trying out Code.org during elementary school but had never had the courage to actually try joining a class. That is until last year when I decided to join Computer Science Software Engineering. At first it was extremely challenging as I had never used an actual coding language before, with my only experience being some usage of C## in my Robotics class with Mr. Campillo and lots of block coding. 
After much trial and tribulation I finished CSSE (Computer Science and Software Engineering) and had a lot of fun, which led me to choose this class (Computer Sciecne Principles)
