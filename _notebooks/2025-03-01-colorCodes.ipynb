    "# Understanding Color Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Color codes are used in web design and graphic design to represent colors in a specific format that can be understood by computers. Different color models and formats allow designers and developers to specify colors in various ways. In this guide, we'll explore the most common color codes, how they work, and how they're used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Color Codes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Color codes are strings or values used to define a specific color. These codes are recognized by design software, web browsers, and digital devices to display the exact color chosen. There are various formats for color codes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hexadecimal (Hex) Code**\n",
    "- **RGB Code**\n",
    "- **HSL Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do Color Codes Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Color codes are essential because they allow for consistency in design. Using specific color codes ensures that colors appear the same across different devices and browsers. It also provides flexibility and control in digital design, allowing designers to work with precise shades.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Color Code Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Hexadecimal (Hex) Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hex code** is a 6-character string that represents a color in base-16 (hexadecimal) notation. It is commonly used in web design and is prefixed with a `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format:** `#RRGGBB`\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - `RR` = Red (00-FF in hexadecimal)\n",
    "  - `GG` = Green (00-FF in hexadecimal)\n",
    "  - `BB` = Blue (00-FF in hexadecimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pair of characters represents the intensity of red, green, and blue on a scale from 0 (none) to 255 (full intensity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- `#FF5733` represents a reddish-orange color.\n",
    "  - `FF` (Red)\n",
    "  - `57` (Green)\n",
    "  - `33` (Blue)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RGB Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The **RGB code** defines color in terms of its Red, Green, and Blue components. It is widely used in web design and digital imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format:** `rgb(R, G, B)`\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - `R` = Red (0-255)\n",
    "  - `G` = Green (0-255)\n",
    "  - `B` = Blue (0-255)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value ranges from 0 (none) to 255 (maximum intensity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- `rgb(255, 87, 51)` represents a reddish-orange color.\n",
    "  - 255 = Red\n",
    "  - 87 = Green\n",
    "  - 51 = Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. HSL Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The **HSL** color model defines colors using three components: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format:** `hsl(H, S%, L%)`\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - `H` = Hue (0-360 degrees, representing the color's position on the color wheel)\n",
    "  - `S%` = Saturation (0%-100%, how vivid the color is)\n",
    "  - `L%` = Lightness (0%-100%, how light or dark the color is)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- `hsl(9, 100%, 60%)` represents a reddish-orange color.\n",
    "  - 9Â° = Hue (around red-orange on the color wheel)\n",
    "  - 100% = Saturation (fully saturated color)\n",
    "  - 60% = Lightness (moderately light)\n",
