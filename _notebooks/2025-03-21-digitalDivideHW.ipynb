    "# Essay Practice Questions\n",
    "1. Explain how economic factors contribute to the digital divide and propose policy solutions that might address these economic barriers.\n",
    "    Economic factors contribute to the digital divide by making it harder to access digital devices. Such as laptops, iPhones and other various devices. Most mainstream devices are priced at over $1000 and makes it so most people can't afford the luxary of purchasing one. However by creating and spreading knowledge of cheaper options and providing more support for these kinds of devices we can cross the digial divide between the rich and poor.\n",
    "2. Describe three dimensions of the digital divide and explain how each affects access to educational resources. Provide specific examples.\n",
    "    There are many dimensions to the digital divide. One such aspect is the finance, in which people need to pay money in order to obtain a digital device in the first place. This makes it much more difficult for poeple to begin their journey on the internet. When a person who previously has no work with the digial divide manages to cross the finance barrier they hit the digital knowledge barrier. This barrier is caused by a lack of knowledge on how to actually use the device they got and in the end it becomes difficult or even a hindrance to use. Another dimension to the digital divide is something that is difficult people to control which is the internet speeds or bandwidth. In more remote areas on underdeveloped areas there may not be as good of a service for internet due to companies having low interest in investing in these areas due to the low possible income."
