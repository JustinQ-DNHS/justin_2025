# Practice MCQ - 2021
For the 2021 Practice MCQ I got a new score of 64/70, this is considerablly higher than previous scores that I had gotten on the MCQs. Generally I messed up most on sectionp 2.B which focuses on implementing and applying an algorithm. I also struggled with investigating computing innovations and evaluating solution options.

## Why Did I Striuggle? 
For most of the 2.B questions I believe that I was just rushing the quiz too fast and did not take the time to work through the question and arrive at th correct answer. I'll take more time and practice so that I can solve the questions faster with more accuracy. I'll also need to work on exploring computer innovations. I believe that rewatching the Big Idea videos will help me understand this important part of the test.
