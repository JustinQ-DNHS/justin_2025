    "We showed our website at Night at the Museum, this is it<a href=\"https://voyager162.github.io/binaryFrontend/\">here</a>. We had 3 main visitors that come to mind, my own parents and Shriya's mother. We went over the website and after explaining how binary works let them try out Weston's game. They seemed receptive to it and tried playing it, getting decently far before we cut it short in order to demo the next feature. We then showed them Binary Overflow and explained it's purpose, we didn't go too in-depth on it as we were running low on time due to the amount of time spent talking about Weston's game. We then went over Shaurya and Rutvik's game where they were meant to solve trivia. Unfortunately it was much too difficult and we didn't see much progress in that area. \n",
